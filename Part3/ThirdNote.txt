Shared Objects in POSIX systems
==========================
POSIX - Portable Operating Systems Interface eXtensions
       - IEEE standard (1988 )
       - A Standard Operating Systems Interface Specifications
ABI - Application Binary Interface 
       - Windows , POSIX ABIs
       - 32 bit ABI for Windows and GNU Linux was more or less similar
       - 64 bit it diverges

WINE - Wine Is Not an Emulator 
           - Has Complications due divergence in the ABI

Etherium has got it's own ABI
          - Solidity and one more language can be used to create Smart Contract
         
----------------------------

extern "C" int Add(int a, int b );

          - Above stuff is called Function Prototype
          - Meta Linguistic Abstractions ( MLA )
                    - SICP chapter 4
          - a & b are called Formal Parameters
          - Add(x,y)  => Actual Parameters
          - x => a , y => b - Binding 
==============================
Suppose there is function which takes two formal parameters viz a, b 
and actual parameters at the call site is 2*4, temp

extern "C" Foo( int a, int b );

Foo(2*4, temp ); //Call site 

=======================================
Foo & Bar are called "Meta Syntatic Variables" 
       - BarCamp => 
       - FOO camp => Friend's Of Orielly (Tim Orielly )
       - FOO became a PR scandal ( being an Invite only conference)
       - IF there is a  FOO camp, why there can't be a BAR camp?
       - FOO is a conference, BAR is a unconfernce
       - FOO is invite only , BAR is open
       - FOO has Agenda , BAR has got Presentation list (by participants )
Apache Cordova  (PhoneGAP ) was developed in a BarCamp

Ivin Gancius took a session on "Startups and Registration formalities"
Kenney Jacob 
==============================================
g++ -c MathLib.cpp // produced MathLib.o
g++ -c first.cpp // produced first.o

g++ -o temp.exe first.o MathLib.o // produces temp.exe as output

g++ first.o MathLib.o   => produces a.out ( Default Filename )

====================================================
What is the name of the Librarian in Windows?
         - LIB.exe
         - ar  ( archive file )

LD => Configurable Linker from GCC project

We can archive MathLib.o and MathLib2.o into a single library file

=============================================================
Dynamic Loading of DLLs
         - LoadLibrary => dlopen
         - GetProcAddress => dlsym
         - FreeLibrary => dlclose

set BIN = //compiler executable path
set LIB = /a/test;b/test2
set INCLUDE = // include path here
